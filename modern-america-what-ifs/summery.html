        <p id = "main"> If the US bombed Germany before the Axis powers were formed then there might not be any World War II. Sure, there would also not be any Germany left. But if the U.S. bombed Russia, then there would not be any Cold war and definitely no space race at that time. If no space race, no people on the moon. America is weird, they probably would not have gone to the moon, if they were not challenged to do so.</p>
