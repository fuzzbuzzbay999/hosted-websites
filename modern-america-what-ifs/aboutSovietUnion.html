        <p id = "main">In June 1941, the Soviet union joined the allies after being attacked by Germany. But before they were allies, America could have bombed the Soviet union because they were supplying Germany with supplies. Had America bombed them then, Japan would have attacked the U.S instead of Germany, because Germany didn't whant to get involved in direct war with the US. In addition, I believe there would not be a Cold war because no one would want to attack the U.S. after being bombed. There would also be no space race because that happened in response to the Cold war, so therefor no people would have landed on the moon as early as they did.</p>
