        <p id = "heading" style = " padding-left: 15%;"> What was the Manhattan Project?</p>
        <p id = "main"> The Manhattan Project was started because two German scientists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission which is the driving force of atomic bombs. A few months later, two American scientists Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard sent a letter to President Roosevelt, telling him that Germany could be trying to make an atomic bomb. So what was the Manhattan project for, you may ask?  Well... I am going to answer that for you. The Manhatten project was created to make atomic bombs also in response to this information.</p>
