        <p id = "main"> The very simple reason why America didn't Bomb Germany is because it took too long. Nuclear fission was discovered in 1939, and it took about 6 years to develop the atomic bomb. It was too late into the war to bomb Germany because we didn't want to get involved with Russia and Japan. Maybe, if the technology was discovered before 1933, America would have bombed Germany. This would have been before the axis powers were formed and there might not have even been a World War II.</p>
